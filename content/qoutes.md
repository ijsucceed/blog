> Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary. — Blaise Pascal

> As a man thinks in his heart, so he is.
— King Solomon, The richest man ever lived

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. — Excerpt from the speech “Citizenship In A Republic” delivered by Theodore Roosevelt at the Sorbonne, in Paris, France on 23 April, 1910

> There are only three types of people; those who have found God and serve him; those who have not found God and seek him, and those who live not seeking, or finding him. The first are rational and happy; the second unhappy and rational, and the third foolish and unhappy. — Blaise Pascal

> In difficult times carry something beautiful in your heart. — Blaise Pascal
